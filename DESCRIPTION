Description: Bayesian hierarchical methods for the detection of differences in rates of related outcomes for multiple treatments for clustered observations (Carragher et al. (2020) <doi:10.1002/sim.8563>). This software was developed for the Precision Drug Theraputics: Risk Prediction in Pharmacoepidemiology project as part of a Rutherford Fund Fellowship at Health Data Research (UK), Medical Research Council (UK) award reference MR/S003967/1 (<https://gtr.ukri.org/>). Principal Investigator: Raymond Carragher.
